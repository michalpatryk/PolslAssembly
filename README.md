# PolslAssembly
Project made for Politechnika Śląska.
The point of the project was learning how to use assembly dll in C++ project. The asm library is performing binarization on bmp file. Asm code is using SIMD instructions.
There are 2 solutions in this repository - Abandoned AssemblyBitmapBinarizationApp, which I tried to make with winapi and failed horribly,
and second repository - JAProjekt, which is a fully functional Qt windows aplication.
